## VM Installation with Vagrant
For Windows users open Git bash, for Mac OS users open terminal. Execute the command
```
pwd
```
This command shows the present working directory.
We will be creating our files in c drive. Mac OS users should be using Desktop. Let's change directory to that location
```
cd /c/
```
Now we will create a directory/folder called vagrant_vms in this location 
```
mkdir vagrant_vms
```
Execute ```pwd``` command to see your location and change directory to the newly created directory.
```
cd vagrant_vms
```
